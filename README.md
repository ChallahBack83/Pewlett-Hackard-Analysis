# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project was to find out how many of Pewlett-Hackard's employees are retirement ready and how prepared the company is to handle that number of retirees. Do they have enough senior employees eligible to mentor under the outgoing employees and to help prepare the next generation of employees?  We did this through an analysis of the employee data which included using information about birth dates, titles, and departments.
